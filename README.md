# Research Engineering Intern Assignment - Social Media Analysis Dashboard

[Hosted Prototype](YOUR_HOSTED_PROTOTYPE_URL_HERE) | [Video Prototype](YOUR_VIDEO_PROTOTYPE_URL_HERE)

A powerful, interactive dashboard for analyzing social media conversations, trends, and network dynamics. This tool allows researchers and analysts to explore patterns in social media data, identify key trends, and detect coordinated behavior.

## Features

- **Social Media Insights: Trends, Sentiments and Discussions**: Analyzes patterns in social media conversations using natural language processing, tracks sentiment changes through text analysis, and identifies emerging discussion topics using topic modeling
- **Key Metrics**: Provides essential statistics including post volume, engagement rates, and user activity levels calculated from the dataset
- **Word Cloud**: Generates interactive word clouds using D3.js, visualizing term frequencies with dynamic sizing and color gradients
- **Top Contributors**: Identifies and analyzes the most active users based on post frequency, comment counts, and engagement metrics
- **A Comprehensive Data Story**: Generates AI-powered narratives using LLaMA model via Groq API, synthesizing key insights and patterns from the data
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tracks post volume and engagement metrics over time using interactive D3.js visualizations with customizable date ranges
- **Topic Evolution Graph**: Visualizes topic changes over time using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) with interactive D3.js charts showing topic prevalence trends
- **Community Distribution Pie Chart**: Displays the distribution of posts and users across different communities using interactive D3.js visualizations
- **Topic Analysis**: Implements LDA topic modeling with customizable number of topics, word weights, and representative document examples
- **Semantic Map**: Creates a 2D visualization using UMAP dimensionality reduction and SentenceTransformer embeddings, with interactive clustering and topic labeling
- **Coordinated Post Groups**: Detects potentially coordinated posting activity using content similarity analysis and temporal pattern recognition
- **AI-Powered Interactive Chatbot**: Integrates Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model for natural language queries about the dataset, providing detailed insights and analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- Node.js (for advanced frontend development)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd social-media-analysis-dashboard
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your data file in the correct location:
   ```
   mkdir -p data
   # Place your data.jsonl file in the ./data directory
   ```

4. Set up environment variables for API integrations:
   ```
   # Create a .env file in the project root
   echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key" > .env
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key" >> .env
   ```
   - Get a Groq API key by signing up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys)
   - Get a Gemini API key by signing up at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/)

## Usage

### Starting the Application

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Using the Dashboard

1. **Search Query**: Enter a search term in the query box and click "Analyze Data"
2. **Filtering**: Optionally specify a date range to narrow your analysis
3. **Exploring Data**: Use the tabs to navigate between different analysis types:
   - Overview: High-level metrics and AI summary
   - Time Series: Post frequency over time
   - Network Analysis: User interaction network
   - Topic Analysis: Key themes and topics
   - Coordinated Behavior: Detection of potentially coordinated posting
   - Chatbot: Interactive AI assistant for asking questions about the dataset

### Dynamic Descriptions Feature

Each visualization section includes real-time, context-aware descriptions that:
- Are generated by the LLaMA 3 model via Groq API
- Adapt to the specific query and dataset being analyzed
- Provide meaningful insights relevant to what's being shown
- Update automatically when parameters or filters change

This feature requires a valid Groq API key in your .env file. Without this key, the system will fall back to generic section descriptions.

### Interactive Chatbot Feature

The dashboard includes an AI-powered chatbot that allows you to:
- Ask natural language questions about the dataset
- Receive detailed, structured responses with insights derived from the data
- Get comprehensive analysis of trends, topics, communities, and engagement
- View well-formatted responses with proper headings, lists, and paragraphs

The chatbot leverages Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to generate informative responses based on:
- The content of your query
- Analysis of patterns in the dataset
- Statistical metrics computed from the data
- Intent detection to provide the most relevant information

This feature requires a valid Gemini API key in your .env file. Without this key, the system will fall back to template-based responses.

## Data Requirements

This application requires a JSONL file with Reddit data in the following format:

```json
{"data": {"id": "post_id", "author": "username", "created_utc": 1627484400, "title": "Post title", "selftext": "Post content", "subreddit": "subreddit_name", "num_comments": 42, "permalink": "/r/subreddit/comments/post_id/title/"}}
```

Each line should contain a separate JSON object with a "data" field that contains the post information.

### Key Fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the post
- `author`: Username of the post author
- `created_utc`: Unix timestamp of when the post was created
- `title`: Title of the post
- `selftext`: Main content of the post
- `subreddit`: The subreddit where the post was published
- `num_comments`: Number of comments on the post
- `permalink`: Relative URL path to the post on Reddit
- `parent_id`: For comments, the ID of the parent post/comment (prefixed with t3_ for posts)

## Enhancement Options

### Adding More Data
To analyze different datasets, replace the data.jsonl file in the ./data directory with your own file following the same format.

### Customizing Visualizations
The frontend visualizations can be customized by editing the files in the static/js directory.

### Adding New Features
The modular design allows for easy extension with new analysis types:
1. Add a new API endpoint in app.py
2. Create a new visualization function in dashboard.js
3. Add a new tab in index.html

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **No data loaded error**: Ensure your data.jsonl file is properly formatted and placed in the ./data directory
- **Visualization not appearing**: Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Slow performance**: Try reducing the size of your dataset or limiting your query scope
- **Dynamic descriptions not working**: Verify your GROQ_API_KEY is correctly set in the .env file and that you have an active account
- **Chatbot not generating detailed responses**: Verify your GEMINI_API_KEY is correctly set in the .env file and that you have an active Google AI Studio account
